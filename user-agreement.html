Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so some of the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.

        <h2>INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
        <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to release, defend (at Our option), indemnify, and hold We and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms or any other applicable policies of Us(including but not limited to the Guidelines or Rules), (ii) your use of the Services other than as authorized by these Terms, the Guidelines or Rules, (iii) your interactions with other users of the Services, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of your interactions, (iv) any information or materials you submit through the Services, or (v) your violation, or alleged violation, of any laws, regulations or third-party rights (all of the foregoing, “Claims”).

You shall not settle any Claims without prior written consent from Us.

        <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION: AGREEMENT TO ARBITRARY</h2>
        <b>Agreement to Arbitrate and Timing of Claims</b>
        <p>
            YOU AND WE MUTUALLY AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OR THE APPLICABILITY, BREACH, TERMINATION, VALIDITY, ENFORCEMENT, OR INTERPRETATION THEREOF OR TO THE ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT, OR NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (COLLECTIVELY, “DISPUTE”) WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION (THE “ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”). ARBITRATION MEANS THAT THE DISPUTE WILL BE RESOLVED BY A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. THE ARBITRATOR WILL DECIDE ALL THRESHOLD QUESTIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ISSUES RELATING TO THE ENFORCEABILITY, REVOCABILITY, OR VALIDITY OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND WHETHER EITHER PARTY LACKS STANDING TO ASSERT HIS/HER/CLAIM(S).
        </p>
        <p>
            YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, REGARDLESS OF ANY STATUTE OR LAW TO THE CONTRARY, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR BE FOREVER BARRED.
        </p>
        <b>Exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement</b>
        <p>
            Notwithstanding the Arbitration Agreement, you and We each agree that (i) any dispute that may be brought in small claims court may be instituted in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) either you or We may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin infringement or another misuse of either party’s intellectual property rights (including without limitation, violation of any data use restrictions contained in these Terms or other misuse of the Services) or based on other exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).
        </p>
        <b>Pre-Arbitration Notification and Good Faith Negotiation</b>
        <p>
            Before initiating an arbitration, you agree to provide Us with notice of the dispute, which notice shall include a brief, written description of the dispute, the relief requested, and your contact information. You must send any such notice to Us by email at zundalapps365@gmail.com, with “Us-Disputes” in the subject line. The parties agree to use their best efforts to resolve any Dispute that is subject to the notification required under this section through informal negotiation, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration by these Terms. If, after a good faith effort to negotiate, one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email before initiating the arbitration.
        </p>
        <b>No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings</b>
        <p>
            YOU AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AS TO ALL DISPUTES. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THERE WILL BE NO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ARBITRATION IN WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. FURTHER, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT A DISPUTE CAN NOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS OR OTHER TYPE OF REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, WHETHER WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF ARBITRATION, OR ON BEHALF OF ANY OTHER INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If the class action waiver contained in this Section 9.5 is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by the courts in the state of Oregon, Multnomah County, or the United States District Court for Oregon, and the parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.
        </p>
