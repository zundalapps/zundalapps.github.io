        <h1 style="text-align: center;">App Community Guidelines</h1>
        <p>
            The app was created to provide a platform where people could connect with other people of diverse backgrounds and experiences that may differ from their own. App's Community Guidelines are intended to further that goal by providing general guidance and explaining what is and isn’t allowed on App. They are not intended to comprehensively identify every type of inappropriate or unlawful conduct or content. Users should be guided by common sense and an expectation that they should treat their fellow users with respect.
        </p>
        <p>
            These Community Guidelines apply to your access to and use of the App and any services offered by the App (collectively, the “Services”). App reserves the right to revise these Community Guidelines at any time for any reason and updates will be posted to the Services. These Community Guidelines are in addition to the App <a href="user-agreement.html">Terms of Service</a>, which also apply to your access to and use of the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            App reserves the right to ban (temporarily or permanently) or take other appropriate action with or without notice concerning any user that engages in conduct that App determines, in its sole discretion, to be inappropriate or harmful, whether or not such conduct is identified below.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you encounter conduct or content on the Services that you believe violates any of the guidelines below or if you have other safety concerns about the Services, please contact App at <a href="zundalapps365@gmail.com">zundalapps365@gmail.com</a> and include “App-Safety” in the subject line. While App is not responsible to you as a user for enforcing these Community Guidelines, reports of violations are helpful to App.
